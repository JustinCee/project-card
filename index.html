          <p>
            This is a timeline created using HTM and CSS. It tracks my work
            experience and it uses animations as well so my experience pops up
            on my timeline. The background changes as well.

          <p>
            This testimonial page was created using Owl-Carousel. It is a slider
            so that it doesn't look cluttered with information and you can read
            one at a time. I have used information provided to me from my peers.
